	<h3>Northern Nigeria</h3>
	<p style="text-indent: 40px;">Northern Nigeria is a very dry place, and its only gotten worse. Much of Northern Nigeria is high and flat planes with a lot of trees.</p>
	<p style="text-indent: 40px;">Northern Nigeria has 2 main ethnic groups, the Hausa and the Fulani. The original people were the Hausa. More than 1/3 of the population speak Hausa, while the Fulani speak the less common Fulfulde.</p>

	<h3>Western Nigeria</h3>
	<p style="text-indent: 40px;">Western Nigeria is a very crowded place with "go-slows" (traffic jams) regularly happening.</p>
	<p style="text-indent: 40px;">When people first arrived in Western Nigeria, a forest had developed along the coastline, but when the people arrived, they cut it down to make more farmland and to sell wood for whatever the people may need.</p>
	<p style="text-indent: 40px;">Western Nigeria is dominated by the Yoruba, who arrived at around 100 B.C.E</p>

	<h3>Eastern Nigeria</h3>
	<p style="text-indent: 40px;">Eastern Nigeria is along the Gulf of Guinea. This region receives a lot more rainfall because it was originally a rain forest. Now, its mostly swamps along the coast.</p>
	<p style="text-indent: 40px;">The predominant culture of Eastern Nigeria is the Igbo (pronounced as "ee-bo"). Before the british colonial rule, there were many igbo dialects spoken, now there isn't unfortunately.</p>
